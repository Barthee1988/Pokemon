## About The Project

Pokemon. The name itself is enough for us it takes us to our childhood life.

In this application, we show all generations of pokemon in one place in card view.

You can be navigating the page to see all the pokemon.

## Usage

When the page opens, it will show ten cards of Pokemon.

We can select any Pokemon and view the details about the Pokemon.

We can search and filter which is available in the list.

For example, if we search name matched with the text "max". It will filter and give the result.

## Roadmap

Open the pokemon_cardview.html page and it will redirect us to the Pokemon view page.

Click anyone of the Pokemon. We can see the detailed description of that Pokemon.

You see the available Pokemon using the navigation option.

You can filter the Pokemon list using Name, Height & Weight.

You can display records by 10, 20 & 50.

## Contributing

It was a wonderful experience to work on an application using API.

I got an opportunity to learn how to get the data using API. Its new to me.

Pushing HTML application into Githud is new to me.
